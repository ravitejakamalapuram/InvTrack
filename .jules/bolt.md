## 2024-05-22 - O(N) XIRR Calculation in List Sorting

**Learning:**
Reactive lists that depend on computed properties for sorting can trigger expensive calculations for EVERY item in the list, even if the item is off-screen. In this case, `filteredInvestmentsProvider` was calculating XIRR (an iterative solver) for every investment just to sort them by date.

**Action:**
Split expensive computations into separate providers or optional flags. We created `investmentBasicStatsProvider` which skips XIRR calculation, reducing the sorting cost from O(N * Iterations) to O(N) for basic arithmetic. Only used the expensive provider when explicitly sorting by XIRR.

## 2024-05-23 - Blocking UI with Synchronous XIRR Calculation

**Learning:**
Even with separate providers, performing iterative calculations (like XIRR) synchronously on the main thread inside a `Provider` body causes UI jank. This is because `ref.watch` triggers immediate re-evaluation when dependencies change, blocking the frame.

**Action:**
Offloaded the calculation to a background isolate using `compute`. Converted the provider to a `FutureProvider` and used `ref.watch(provider.selectAsync(...))` to maintain reactivity while allowing the heavy lifting to happen in parallel.

## 2024-05-24 - Hidden Shadow Rendering in Glass Cards

**Learning:**
When using `BackdropFilter` with `ClipRRect`, placing a `BoxShadow` on the inner container (inside the clip) results in the shadow being calculated and painted but immediately clipped out (invisible). This wastes GPU cycles, especially in long scrolling lists where every item has this "invisible" shadow.

**Action:**
Modified `GlassCard` to explicitly remove the `boxShadow` from the inner container when `blur > 0`. This ensures we don't pay the rendering cost for a shadow that the user can never see.
