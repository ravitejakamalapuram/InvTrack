## 2024-05-22 - O(N) XIRR Calculation in List Sorting

**Learning:**
Reactive lists that depend on computed properties for sorting can trigger expensive calculations for EVERY item in the list, even if the item is off-screen. In this case, `filteredInvestmentsProvider` was calculating XIRR (an iterative solver) for every investment just to sort them by date.

**Action:**
Split expensive computations into separate providers or optional flags. We created `investmentBasicStatsProvider` which skips XIRR calculation, reducing the sorting cost from O(N * Iterations) to O(N) for basic arithmetic. Only used the expensive provider when explicitly sorting by XIRR.
